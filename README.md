# Lab5.java
Read the contents of words.txt into a String array.
2) Pick a random word from the array (you will need to use a random number generator).
3) Using StringBuilder, randomly “jumble” the characters in the chosen word. The given Java file contains a
suggestion for how to jumble the letters.
4) Display the jumbled word and repeatedly ask the user to guess the original word. Continue until the user
guesses correctly (up to 5 guess max) and then display out how many tries it took them (if 5 or less) otherwise
display “Maximum number of guesses reached - word was” and display word.
5) Ask if they want to run the program again
